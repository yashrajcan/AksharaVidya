## Exploring Architecture

### Model used:
In this project we have used Random forest which is an ensemble learning algorithm that uses a collection of decision trees to make predictions. we will apply this model in Modelbit to make an usable API from it which then we will use in our app. 

### App technology:
We have used Flutter to make the application because of its cross native platform support.

### User interaction:
User will be able to detect if he/she have dyslexia or not by simply answering a questionnaire.
User then can improve his/her condition by taking exercises on our app for spellings and pronunciation.
